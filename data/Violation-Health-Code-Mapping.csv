Everyday Gourmet Deli, Inc., Dkt No. 0645112F1 (App. Unit Oct. 4, 2012) (rejecting necessary preparation defense when respondent failed to show preparation required food to be out of temperature). And, food being reheated, thawed, cooled or labeled for time and temperature and monitored under Time as a Public Health Control (TPHC) may be out of temperature only if the restaurant is following the required Health Code methods for these procedures. See, e.g., DOHMH v. Restaurants LLC Trump, Dkt No. 2335313F1 (App. Unit Feb. 12, 2014) (rejecting reheating defense when respondent used improper reheating method); DOHMH v.
